                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
            Clear the grid and create your own seed and watch it morph, prosper or die.
